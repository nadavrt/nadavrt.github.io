			<h1>How to create your own Wordpress Ajax handler</h1>
		</div>
		<article>
<p>If Wordpress is your CMS of choice you've probably gotten used to logging into the your admin panel via the wp-admin directory. 
Being part of the back-end of your website, the wp-admin directory should not be accessible to users who casually browse your website. 
In fact, many companies limit access to that directory by IP to prevent just that. And yet Wordpress' own Ajax handler 
(admin-ajax.php) resides in that same directory. So whenever an Ajax call is made in response to a user viewing and or using a feature on a page
your wp-admin directory is accessed. If you consider that practise to be unhealthy know that Wordpress' own Ajax handler is optional for front-end use. 
In fact, admin-ajax.php should only be used for back-end admin and API related Ajax calls.<br/>
This tutorial will walk you through creating your own Ajax hanlder, which you can place in your theme or plugin directory, depending on your need.<br/>
</p>

<p>
The advantages of creating your own Wordpress Ajax hanlder are numerous. They include:
<ul>
	<li>Less clutter - each time admin-ajax.php is refered to an impressive array of admin-related functions and features is loaded.
	These functions are irrelevant for the front-end. By not loading all of this clutter our Ajax handler will become more efficient.</li>
	<li>Directory masking - the Ajax handler will be situated in the theme/plugin directory instead of the wp-admin directory. 
	This abolishes the need to grant access to the wp-admin directory and thus prevent a resource from being loaded from it.</li>
	<li>Dedicated call handling - a dedicated Ajax handler for your plugin makes it independent of the inate Wordpress Ajax 
	handler, thus separating it from the Wordpress core. This is a good development practise, as well as a safeguard.</li>
	<li>Better security - You can filter and validate functions before performing an ajax call.</li>
	<li>Specify a custom return value - admin-ajax.php uses <code>die('0');</code> as it's default return value but your Ajax handler can specify it's own unique return value. 
	This is especially helpful if your plugin or application requires specific responses.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Handler</h2>
<p>Let us create a new Ajax handler for our theme. First create a new file called ajax.php inside your theme directory 
and paste the following code inside it:
<pre class="brush: php; toolbar: false;">
	define('DOING_AJAX', TRUE);
	if ( !isset($_POST['action']) ) die(FALSE);

	require_once('../../../wp-load.php');
	@header( 'Content-Type: text/html; charset=' . get_option( 'blog_charset' ) );
	@header( 'X-Robots-Tag: noindex' );
	send_nosniff_header();
	header('Cache-Control: no-cache');
	header('Pragma: no-cache');
	$allowedActions = array(
		'my_function',
		'another_function'
	);
	$action = $_POST['action'];

	if ( in_array($action, $allowedActions) )
	{
		if ( is_user_logged_in() ) do_action( 'wp_ajax_' . $action );
		else do_action( 'wp_ajax_nopriv_' . $action );
	}
	else die(FALSE);
</pre>
<p>Our very own Ajax handler is compact and reletively simple. It only loads the bare minimum required to perform an Ajax call. In fact,
we stripped it of the many admin-related functions admin-ajax.php offers, because they are not needed for a front-end handler. 
Also note how we limit this Ajax handler to the functions specified in the <code>$allowedActions</code> array. 
admin-ajax.php is programmed to be gready - if a proper Ajax function exists with the same name as the passed action that function will be accessed. 
Our custom Ajax handler prevents this potential security pitfall by restricting the actions it can take to our predefined array.
Most importantly, our Ajax handler lives in the themes directory together with the rest of the content a front-end user is allowed to see.
</p>

<h2>A specialized handler</h2>
<p>Since you choose which files/plugins interact with your tailor-made handler it can be specialized in a way admin-ajax.php could never be.
Here is a proof of concept that shows just how special your ajax handler can be:
<pre class="brush: php; toolbar: false;">
	//Our Ajax handler has a default action, so the $_POST['action'] existence check has been removed.
	define('DOING_AJAX', TRUE);
	require_once('../../../wp-load.php');
	@header( 'Content-Type: text/html; charset=' . get_option( 'blog_charset' ) );
	@header( 'X-Robots-Tag: noindex' );
	send_nosniff_header();
	header('Cache-Control: no-cache');
	header('Pragma: no-cache');
	$allowedActions = array(
		'my_function',
		'another_function'
	);

	//Let's add a default action.
	$action = (isset($_POST['action']))? $_POST['action']:'my_function';
	$action = (in_array($action, $allowedActions))? $action:'my_function';
	
	//This handler will only handle my plugin calls so the function prefix can adhere to the plugin. 
	//I also don't need to enable any admin privileges so both logged in and logged out users can use the same prefix.
	do_action( 'myPlugin_' . $action );
</pre>

<h2>A Word of Caution</h2>
<p>The handler we created is great for frontend use, but is not a replacement for admin-ajax.php. Our handler is nimble because important
back-end features such as the Administration API and other Wordpress-core related POST actions have been intentionally stripped from it. 
If your plugin/feature makes Ajax calls from within the admin panel admin-ajax.php is your best choice. admin-ajax.php was created for handling admin-specific 
tasks and is a resource that Wordpress itself loads on every admin page for its core features (such as editing, saving and updating of posts and menus).
