# TODO 

- Replace PHP with JavaScript.
- Deploy to Github Pages.
- Make sure trying to access a non-existent page does not list the content of folders (directory listing should be disabled, just like before)
- Create a Go Lambda function to facilitate email sending.

Bonus: consider moving the articles over to Notion?
